I’m Xingzhou CHEN (陈星周), currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2021-Present), supervised by Prof. [Ling SHI](https://eesling.home.ece.ust.hk/) (施凌). I received my bachelor degree (2017-2021) at Zhejiang University, majoring in Automation, College of Control Science and Engineering. Previously, I joined the [State Key Laboratory of CAD & CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/) as an research assistant, supervised by Prof. [Jin HUANG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/hj/index.xml) (黄劲) and worked as a research intern at [Tencent Robotics X](https://roboticsx.tencent.com/#/) Lab and [Huawei Noah's Ark](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/) Lab.

In the past, I aspired to advance systems through mathematics. Since 2024, I have become convinced that robot learning will revolutionize the principles and methodologies of model-based control. Therefore, my current research interest is to **systematically develop robotics technologies** through the redefinition of state representation, policy evolution, and perception-guided reasoning.

Research Experience
======
Overall, my research experience can be divided into four stages. 
 - how to use computers to simulate the real world
 - how to apply mathematical methods in simulation for system reasoning
 - how to employ machine learning in simulation to enable robotic intelligence
 - how to transfer intelligence from simulation to real-world robots

During my undergraduate studies (2019 – 2021), although I majored in robotics, my interest lay in how computers **simulate the world**. To pursue this, I took a course in Numerical Analysis and achieved the highest score, which gave me the opportunity to join Prof. Jin HUANG’s CG Lab. There, I became good friends with the "Stanford Bunny", meshlized the world and helped to construct the physical engine. This experience greatly enhanced my skills in C++ and data structures.

In the first three years of my PhD (2021 – 2024), my research focused on **developing secure and reasoning-capable control systems grounded in mathematics**. My focus was not on generic input–output reasoning abilities, but rather on how to leverage **Bayesian inference** to screen and validate system inputs in order to ensure system safety. Such self-verifying reasoning enhances a controller’s robustness and its resilience to hazardous conditions—for instance, GPS spoofing in autonomous driving or unexpected actuator (motor) failures in robots.

During the later stage of my PhD (2024 – 2025), I recognized AI’s reshaping of control in physical systems and pursued two internships for **real-world robotics experience**. At Huawei, I controlled robotic arms with VLA models and proposed event flow inputs to **enhance 3D spatial reasoning**. At Tencent, I worked on **RL-based locomotion for diverse humanoids**, including Tencent Xiaowu (wheel-leg hybrid), Unitree G1 (130 cm, 35 kg), and PUDU D9 (165 cm, 65 kg). These experiences deepened my robotics understanding and honed my engineering skills.

Most recently (2025 – ), I aim to **integrate system reasoning into robotic systems**. Two challenges stand out: (i) multimodal end-to-end I/O resists purely mathematical reasoning; and (ii) common actuation anomalies (e.g., oscillations) often arise from human–robot contact. I do not believe any single policy is universally robust to all contacts; instead, we should **reason over system inputs and adapt control accordingly**. I am pursuing a machine-learning approach to HRI challenges — representing, decoding, and leveraging continuous, dense contact streams.
